# Quantum Data Science

This repository contains the exercises and solutions of my Quantum Data Science course at the University of Minho. The course is taught in the 2nd semester of the 1st year of the MSc in Physical Information.

## Lectures

The folder [Lectures](Lectures) contains the corresponding problem sheets and solutions. The content of the lectures is as follows:

1. [Quantum Binary Classification -- Swap Test](Lectures/001-Swap-Test): This lecture introduces the swap test as a quantum binary classifier. Swap test is a quantum algorithm that can be used to calculate the angular proximity between two quantum states. This algorithm is used to classify dots in three-dimensional space given their coordinates. The problem is solved using the Qiskit library.
